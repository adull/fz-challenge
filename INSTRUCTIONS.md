# Firezone Frontend Challenge

This application contains an obvious bug. Some of the paths don't work.

The challenge is simple:

1. Find the bug and fix it. You should hit the bug after launching the local server and clicking around on some links. Expect the fix to be really simple.
1. Add a test framework to this application that will catch bugs like this in
   the future.
1. Open a PR with the changes and ping your interviewer to review.
